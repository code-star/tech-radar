# Tech Radar

## Original Tech Radar
The `./example` folder contains the previous version of the tech radar, as it was updated in 2018.07.
It was sent to me by Hamza in May 2019, with the following comments:
Here’s the tech radar. The data itself is in `scripts/index.js`, the tags are:

* Zalando categories:
    * LG: Language
    * IF: Infrastructure
    * FW: Frameworks
    * DM: Data Management
* Our own categories:
    * BD: Big Data
    * OP: Operations
    * BE: Back-end
    * FE: Front-end
    
We tried to tag every tech someone introduced to the radar with both zalando’s and our categories,
to have two different perspectives and if you open index.html you will see two radars, 
each using those two different categories.
It’s quite out of date by now, it would be interesting to go through those again and see how it changed.
